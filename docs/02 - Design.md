# Design

OSC-Bot (hereafter will be referred to as CrunchBang '#!') is a bot we make
at OSC Project to automate our process of managing ideas, votes and teams.

Therefore, CrunchBang needs 3 features:

- An interface, for admins to control it's functionality
- An interface, for our members to vote, propose new ideas and join/leave teams.
- An interface, for the project leaders to manage each project
- An internal logic for handling teams, both in GitHub and Discord server
