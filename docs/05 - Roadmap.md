1) Creating Voting System:

1.1) Bot's Vote system would be able to get ideas from users in certain format and diaplay it in ideas channel.

1.2) Bot must only allow thumbs up reaction from users.

1.3) Bot must warn user if thumbs up isnt placed.

1.4) Bot must auto give thumbs up on each idea so that user knowns exact icon.


2) Watch and verification system

2.1) Bot listens given channel in this case voting channel for every two weeks regardless of when project is created.

2.2) If after two weeks vote count reaches 5 for any project, bot sends DM to all the participants of those projects.

2.3) Bot asks for voting again to check participant interest. Also asks for their GitHub.

2.4) If participant vote reaches 4 new channels are created and project is removed from ideas channel. All the voters who didnt participate receive warning. they can only not participate to voted project three times before kicked.
Project is displayed on current projects with github link and brief description if enough vote reached in DM.

If not enough voting is made idea votes removed from ideas channel for inactive users , voting is carried on to following two weeks snd check of votes greater than 5 is checked for other two weeks. inactive members can reoeat this behaviour 3 tikes before they get kick. in case of kick all their votes are removed from all ideas.

if after two more weeks any project exceeds voting limit DM send again.

3) Github and creation system

3.1) Highly voted ideas have own channel with own permissions and project names. these channels are only available to participants.roles given by bot. After a week of creation of new channel bot gets votes for lead developer.
All users pinged periodically to participate. If certain vote percentage is reached lead dev picked. Appropiate role given automatically.
If not enough percentage of hsers voted voting system tries second time to ping for a week. then voting dropped.

any member can initiate voting again by command. same process repeats.

Same time with channels new github repo with correct permissions created and new team created automatically and all given githubs in DM invited.

4) Inactivity

Github dont kick inactives with roles. So bot watch each user once two weeks. If user didnt have any update in repo or discord channel they get kick. All their github memberships are removed. New post is made in announcments for new users for that team. Which they can vote and be in that team. Same way bot asks for github and participation in DM and add that user to current team.

Same mechanicsm is for users who vote to participate in current projscts by thumbs up. DM ask for validity and github snd auto add to github and give roles.
